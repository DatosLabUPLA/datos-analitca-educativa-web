  <strong>Ninth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM9)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ÉTM meetings are international symposiums organized in the form of groups of
thematic work based on the contributions of the participants. The format of
symposium encourages exchanges between participants and contributes to creating a
community of researchers with common interests.

In order to facilitate interaction and debate, the number of participants per topic is
limited. Each symposium topic is introduced through a plenary presentation at the
which are remembered, in particular, the achievements of previous symposia. For the ÉTM9
It will have a total capacity limited to 90 participants.
The discussion between the participants is achieved in general plenaries and in the integration to
one of the thematic work groups, which will be specified in the second
call.

Thematic groups discuss and develop theoretical perspectives in didactics on the
mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse,
control and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that
influence mathematical practice, in particular AI and digital. In the context of
learning, the genesis and development of mathematical work is examined, focusing on
the central role of the teacher, the trainers, the groups and the interactions in this
process. Situations and tasks that contribute to the construction and
development of mathematical work, highlighting its importance in the evolution of this
fundamental discipline.

The symposium lasts 5 days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish and
French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be made in
any of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by a
electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other languages ​​of the
symposium.</p>
  <p><strong>Where:</strong> Plantel: Centro Histórico o Del Valle (por precisar)., Mexico City, Mexico</p>
  <p><strong>When:</strong> From 29/06/2026 to 03/07/2026</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ÉTM meetings are international symposiums organized in the form of thematic working groups based on the contributions of the participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with common interests.

The number of participants per topic is limited to facilitate interaction and debate. Each theme of the symposium will be introduced through a plenary presentation recalling, in particular, the achievements of previous symposia.

The four thematic working groups are set out below. We propose to discuss and develop theoretical perspectives in didactics on mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, in particular AI and digital. In the context of learning, we will examine the genesis and development of mathematical work, focusing on the central role of teachers, trainers, collectives and interactions in this process. We will analyze how projects, situations and tasks contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.

The four themes of the symposium focus on certain questions that are developed below, but it is clear that these are not isolated questions. Interthematic meetings will be organized on issues that affect more than one theme, with a grouping of contributions that provides food for thought for everyone.

The symposium will last 5 days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be made in any of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other languages ​​of the symposium.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ETM meetings are international symposiums organized in the form of working groups around topics in mathematics teaching and related fields, based on the presentations of the participants. The symposium formula encourages exchanges between participants and allows the formation of a community of researchers with common interests. The Symposium will last 6 days and will be trilingual, like the previous ones (English, Spanish, French). Communications, both oral and in poster form, may be presented in one of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other two languages ​​of the symposium. The meeting will be organized around four themes, and each contribution must fit into one of the proposed themes. The number of participants is limited to 25 per topic to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each theme of the Symposium will be presented in a plenary session, in which the achievements of previous symposia will be recalled in particular, and exchange activities between the themes are also planned.

The ETM 7 symposium is supported by the "Association pour le Développement et la Diffusion de la Recherche sur les Espaces de Travail Mathématiques (ADRETM)".</p>
  <p><strong>Where:</strong> 141 avenue de Colmar, Strasbourg, France</p>
