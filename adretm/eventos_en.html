  <strong>Ninth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM9)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ÉTM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of thematic working groups based on contributions from participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges among participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with shared interests.

To facilitate interaction and discussion, the number of participants per topic is limited. Each symposium topic is introduced through a plenary presentation, which specifically highlights the achievements of previous symposia. For ÉTM9, a total capacity limit of 90 participants will be set. Discussion among participants will take place in general plenary sessions and through membership in one of the thematic working groups, which will be specified in the second call.

The thematic groups discuss and develop theoretical perspectives on didactics regarding mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control, and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, particularly AI and digital technologies. In the context of learning, the genesis and development of mathematical work is examined, focusing on the central role of the teacher, trainers, groups, and interactions in this process. Situations and tasks that contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work are also analyzed, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.

The symposium lasts five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be submitted in any of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other symposium languages.</p>
  <p><strong>Where:</strong> Plantel: Centro Histórico o Del Valle (por precisar)., Mexico City, Mexico</p>
  <p><strong>When:</strong> From 29/06/2026 to 03/07/2026</p>

  <strong>Eighth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM8)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ÉTM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of thematic working groups based on contributions from participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with shared interests.

The number of participants per topic is limited to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each symposium topic will be introduced through a plenary presentation, which will specifically review the achievements of previous symposia.

The four thematic working groups are outlined below. We propose to discuss and develop theoretical perspectives in didactics on mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control, and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, particularly AI and digital technologies. In the context of learning, we will examine the genesis and development of mathematical work, focusing on the central role of teachers, trainers, collectives, and interactions in this process. We will analyze how projects, situations, and tasks contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.

The four symposium themes focus on certain issues, which are developed below, but it is clear that these are not isolated topics. Interthematic meetings will be organized on issues affecting more than one topic, with a grouping of contributions that will provide food for thought for all.

The symposium will last five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be submitted in any of these three languages; oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other symposium languages.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ETM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of working groups on topics in mathematics education and related fields, based on the presentations of participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and allows for the formation of a community of researchers with common interests. The Symposium will last six days and will be trilingual, like the previous ones (English, Spanish, French). Presentations, both oral and in poster form, may be presented in one of these three languages; oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other two symposium languages. The meeting will be organized around four themes, and each contribution must fit into one of the proposed themes. The number of participants is limited to 25 per theme to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each Symposium theme will be presented in a plenary session, which will specifically review the achievements of previous symposia, and exchange activities between themes are also planned.

The ETM 7 symposium is supported by the "Association pour le Développement et la Diffusion de la Recherche sur les Espaces de Travail Mathématiques (ADRETM)".</p>
  <p><strong>Where:</strong> 141 avenue de Colmar, Strasbourg, France</p>
  <p><strong>When:</strong> From 27/06/2022 to 02/07/2022</p>
