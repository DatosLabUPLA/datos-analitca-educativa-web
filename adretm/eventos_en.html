  <strong>Ninth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM9)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ÉTM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of thematic working groups based on contributions from participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges among participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with shared interests.

To facilitate interaction and discussion, the number of participants per topic is limited. Each symposium topic is introduced through a plenary presentation, which specifically highlights the achievements of previous symposia. For ÉTM9, a total capacity limit of 90 participants will be set. Discussion among participants will take place in general plenary sessions and through membership in one of the thematic working groups, which will be specified in the second call.

The thematic groups discuss and develop theoretical perspectives on didactics regarding mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control, and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, particularly AI and digital technologies. In the context of learning, the genesis and development of mathematical work is examined, focusing on the central role of the teacher, trainers, groups, and interactions in this process. Situations and tasks that contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work are also analyzed, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.

The symposium lasts five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be submitted in any of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other symposium languages.</p>

  <strong>Fourth Days of Study of Mathematical Work (JETM4) – Artificial Intelligence and mathematical work (JTEM4)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Objectives

These study days in mathematics education aim to initiate research in mathematics education on the theme of the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on mathematical work (MT). The main objectives are to understand the didactic challenges in order to support stakeholders in the development of mathematical work integrating AI.

This fourth edition of JETM, more ambitious than the previous ones, will take place over 2.5 days.

Context

The AI-MT theme was officially launched in our research community at the ÉTM8 symposium (October 21-25, 2024, Spain; co-chairs of the scientific committee: L. Vivier and P. R. Richard) with a conference and workshops.

A research project for the Samuel-De Champlain program call for the years 2025 and 2026 was submitted with colleagues from the LDAR and UQAM and UdM in Quebec (responsible Fabienne Venant, UQAM and Laurent Vivier, UPCité). The colleagues of the Quebec team mainly devote their research to the integration of technological tools, with a particular emphasis on algorithmic and instrumental issues and, more specifically, Richard, from UdM, has also developed expertise on the links between AI and mathematics teaching (Richard, Vélez, and Van Vaerenbergh, 2022). The French part, the ETM group of the LDAR, has developed tools for characterizing mathematical work, carried out in an environment enriched by technological tools, in different mathematical fields as well as in the context of modeling tasks. AI is at the crossroads of these different expertises. Its integration into education raises instrumental, algorithmic, pedagogical, and didactic challenges. Focusing the study on the role of AI in problem solving and modeling will allow for the coordination and complementarity of each team's strengths. Fabienne Venant and Laurent Vivier have each requested a six-month leave of absence in 2025 to fully engage in this project and this theme.

A master's thesis in science education is underway on this theme of AI and TM in the context of linear algebra (defense planned for early 2025). This student is expected to continue on to a doctoral program on this AI-TM theme. A master's thesis topic has also been proposed for 2024-2025 by the LDAR's ETM group.</p>

  <strong>Eighth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM8)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ÉTM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of thematic working groups based on contributions from participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with shared interests.

The number of participants per topic is limited to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each symposium topic will be introduced through a plenary presentation, which will specifically review the achievements of previous symposia.

The four thematic working groups are outlined below. We propose to discuss and develop theoretical perspectives in didactics on mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control, and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, particularly AI and digital technologies. In the context of learning, we will examine the genesis and development of mathematical work, focusing on the central role of teachers, trainers, collectives, and interactions in this process. We will analyze how projects, situations, and tasks contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.

The four symposium themes focus on certain issues, which are developed below, but it is clear that these are not isolated topics. Interthematic meetings will be organized on issues affecting more than one topic, with a grouping of contributions that will provide food for thought for all.

The symposium will last five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be submitted in any of these three languages; oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other symposium languages.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ETM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of working groups on topics in mathematics education and related fields, based on the presentations of participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and allows for the formation of a community of researchers with common interests. The Symposium will last six days and will be trilingual, like the previous ones (English, Spanish, French). Presentations, both oral and in poster form, may be presented in one of these three languages; oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other two symposium languages. The meeting will be organized around four themes, and each contribution must fit into one of the proposed themes. The number of participants is limited to 25 per theme to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each Symposium theme will be presented in a plenary session, which will specifically review the achievements of previous symposia, and exchange activities between themes are also planned.

The ETM 7 symposium is supported by the "Association pour le Développement et la Diffusion de la Recherche sur les Espaces de Travail Mathématiques (ADRETM)".</p>
