  <strong>Ninth Symposium on the Study of Mathematical Work (ETM9)</strong><br>

  <div><strong>Description:</strong> <p>ÉTM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of thematic working groups based on contributions from participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges among participants and contributes to creating a community of researchers with shared interests.</p><p>To facilitate interaction and discussion, the number of participants per topic is limited. Each symposium topic is introduced through a plenary presentation, which specifically highlights the achievements of previous symposia. For ÉTM9, a total capacity limit of 90 participants will be set. Discussion among participants will take place in general plenary sessions and through membership in one of the thematic working groups, which will be specified in the second call.</p><p>The thematic groups discuss and develop theoretical perspectives on didactics regarding mathematical work, as well as aspects related to signs, tools, discourse, control, and necessity in mathematical work, thus highlighting the key elements that influence mathematical practice, particularly AI and digital technologies. In the context of learning, the genesis and development of mathematical work is examined, focusing on the central role of the teacher, trainers, groups, and interactions in this process. Situations and tasks that contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work are also analyzed, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.</p><p>The symposium lasts five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French). Contributions (oral presentations and posters) may be submitted in any of these three languages; Oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other symposium languages.</p></div>

  <strong>Fourth Days of Study of Mathematical Work (JETM4) – Artificial Intelligence and mathematical work (JTEM4)</strong><br>
  <span> From 03/11/2025 to 05/11/2025, Paris, France. Modality: In-person</span>

<div id="evento_futuros_en_3" class="collapse event-details">
  <div><strong>Description:</strong> <p>The use of a traditional instrument (including digital ones) supports the construction of meaning. Proof remains the responsibility of the subject and is based on a known theoretical framework shared by the scientific community. The integration of intelligent tools disrupts this balance to the extent that AI takes over part of the discursive dimension and relies on an opaque framework, dependent on the database used to train the model. Integrating intelligent tools requires demanding work on the part of the subject, integrating semiotic, instrumental, and discursive aspects, in a constant adjustment between established principles and ongoing experience.</p><p>The work initiated involves experiments integrating different AI tools into initial teacher training, in mathematics and didactics courses, in France, Chile, and Quebec. These experiments will be conducted in parallel in the various educational systems. The fourth day of the Study of Mathematical Work will be an opportunity to compare our analyses with the structural differences in teacher training between participating countries. These cultural and contextual aspects are essential to support an ethical and responsible approach to framing the use of AI-powered tools. Particular attention will be paid to the challenges of mathematics teacher training, curriculum, and the role of digital technology, and especially AI, in partner countries. These days will be an opportunity to promote joint interventions by researchers.</p></div>

In the context of learning, we will examine the genesis and development of mathematical work, focusing on the central role of teachers, trainers, collectives, and interactions in this process. We will analyze how projects, situations, and tasks contribute to the construction and development of mathematical work, highlighting their importance in the evolution of this fundamental discipline.</p><p>The four symposium themes focus on certain issues, which are developed below, but it is clear that these are not isolated topics. Interthematic meetings will be organized on issues affecting more than one topic, with a grouping of contributions that will provide food for thought for all.</p><p>The symposium will last five days and, like its predecessors, will be trilingual (English, Spanish, and French).

  <div><strong>Description:</strong> <p>ETM meetings are international symposia organized in the form of working groups on topics in mathematics education and related fields, based on the presentations of participants. The symposium format encourages exchanges between participants and allows for the formation of a community of researchers with common interests. The Symposium will last six days and will be trilingual, like the previous ones (English, Spanish, French). Presentations, both oral and in poster form, may be presented in one of these three languages; oral presentations will be accompanied by an electronic slide presentation, which must be in one of the other two symposium languages. The meeting will be organized around four themes, and each contribution must fit into one of the proposed themes. The number of participants is limited to 25 per theme to facilitate interaction and discussion. Each Symposium theme will be presented in a plenary session, which will specifically review the achievements of previous symposia, and exchange activities between themes are also planned.</p><p>The ETM 7 symposium is supported by the "Association pour le Développement et la Diffusion de la Recherche sur les Espaces de Travail Mathématiques (ADRETM)".</p></div>
