Researchers report that teaching fractions from a measuring perspective can promote students’ conceptual understandings. We investigate this hypothesis with brazilian elementary school students and use the pedagogical approach, 4A Instructional Model. Results reveal that the students demonstrated conceptual knowledge about the magnitude comparison of fractions and the construction of equivalence of fractions. They were able evoke mental images of this content and write competently mathematical expressions of fraction magnitude comparisons. Further research is needed to investigate how the measuring perspective taught through the 4A Instructional Model influences students’ understanding about the arithmetic operations of fractions. © 2022, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

Terms such as ‘evidence-based practice’ and ‘epidemiology’ have the Statistics as one of their pillars and are common to the health area. Given the Statistics’ importance, many efforts to improve its teaching and learning have been disseminated in academia. This work shows and analyzes the ways the teaching of Statistics has taken, considering the bibliographical review by Garfield (1995), reestablished by Garfield and Ben-Zvi (2007), focusing on the specific case of the health area by our literature review. This last review included articles published from 2007 to 2017 in journals from health and teaching areas. The literature review analyzed 26 articles, which were classified into two categories: psychological aspects and teaching methodologies. The teaching of Statistics has evolved as an area of study and research. Individual and specific efforts have now received proper institutional guidelines for the teaching of Statistics. However, there are few instruments for evaluating what students learn. Yet, the use of theories of learning is minimal, what impacts on methodologies highly based only on the teachers’ practice. © 2019, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

The methodology includes stages of anticipation, experimentation, analysis using Tracker software, and algebraic formulation. This didactic design motivates students to move from an intuitive perception to an abstract and general understanding of functions. The results highlight students’ progress in linking different representations of functions, whether graphical, algebraic, tabular, or descriptive. Using the Tracker tool was fundamental in supporting the visualization and analysis of the data.

For this purpose, a three-component theoretical model was configured, articulated with the Socioepistemological Theory. Specifically, it shows how the process takes place: what and how awareness is acquired, what knowledge is constructed and what is transformed. For the analysis we considered a category of meanings and another on the forms of argumentation related to direct proportionality; both categories allowed us to understand the state of the teacher’s knowledge at the beginning and at the end of the reflective process. Among the result s we have that the reflect ion of school proportionality gives evidence that the change of relationship to this mathematical knowledge promotes the awareness of responsibility for mathematical education and the development of autonomy over mathematical knowledge (both related to proportionality), two aspects that characterize the professionalization of mathematics teachers. © 2022, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

The results reveal that it is possible to rethink the teaching of some geometric contents at school level, such as Euclid’s theorem and geometric progression, based on the problem of the proportional division of the guitar neck.

The analysis was carried out from a double theoretical perspective: the didactic situations are characterized and analyzed from the Theory of Didactic Situations (Brousseau, 1998), while, for the analysis of teaching practices, the double didactic/ergonomic approach was mainly considered (Robert y Rogalski, 2002) and the ethnographic perspective (Rockwell & Mercado, 2003). Although the transformations identified are different from each other, in both cases, the essentials of the didactic purposes were preserved.

A teaching that considers argumentation and learning of the sample space is recommended to channel the use of intuitive resources. © 2020, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

The theoretical model used considers the study of the constitution of knowledge through the analysis of its genesis, development and transversality. The results reveal in the analyzed work an episteme of the measurement of inaccessible distances that includes both the search for a suitable reason to carry out the measurement and the dynamic analysis of the behavior of the shadows or the visual rays in the estimation of inclinations.

Products and quotients can be defined in terms of general relational schemes. In this study, we examine whether elementary school children can construct a system of numbers such that fraction multiplication and division are based on the construction of general relational schemes. Groups of students are not homogeneous and children progress at different rates. For reliable assessment teachers need methods to examine developmental and individual differences in cognitive representations of mathematical concepts and operations. A logistic regression curve offers a visualisation of the learning process as a function of average marks.

The conclusions of the study indicate that the level of performance in Mathematics of a student may not translate the level of performance of that student in the construction of proofs. They also suggest a possible connection between the contents, and the experience, associated to the first contact of the students with proof and the representations used by them in the proof schemes. Last but not least, the conclusions shed light on the meanings for the students of proof schemes which are not deductive.

The results show students are more creative when they design strategies than when they execute them or review the whole process; students distinguish all the parts of a resolution; but there is a poor capacity of communicating, organizing and synthesizing resolutions.

The analysis focuses on identifying whether children recognize different units, simple or compound, and the use they made of them, particularly if children build units to address the given situations, and whether the children re-interpretate the said situations with these units. This research was conducted by using the method of task-based interviews, from which it was possible to find evidence of the strategies used by the children, in particular two emerging strategies that have not been reported in the international literature: equivalence between different types of unit and coordinated use of composite units. © 2018, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

This issue has been analyzed based on the understanding of mathematics as a normative rule governed system. This view of mathematics is based on Ludwing Wittgenstein’s analysis of philosophical delimitations as well as Anna Sfard’s theoretical understanding about it. The discourses produced by a group of students and a teacher during the implementation of the modelling have been adopted as empirical material for the analysis of the theme. These data have been collected through observation method. The uses that the students and the teacher attributed the words allowed us to point out that the discursive modeling game is played under the rules instituted in the mathematical way of life developed in the school context. © 2019, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

In turn, the analysis of questionnaires applied to students and teachers indicate: 1) the improper use of calculators or other calculation systems and the tendency of teachers to focus on significant values; 2) that students do not perceive that the use of the calculator for trigonometric functions is mediated by at least two methods of calculation: the sexagesimal and the radian.","Mathematical articulation and convention; Perceptions; Radian; School mathematics; Trigonometric functions","","Spanish","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860343277"

In our thesis project we have shown that situations built on a 3D dynamic geometrical environment can lead the students to rely on this type of geometry. Nonetheless, this evolution would proof itself unstable, and we propose here to examine where the social interactions, and especially via discursive genesis, play a fundamental role in terms of this stability. The proof issue is central to this concern, as it seems to be consubstantial with the transition of assumed Geometry GI to parceled Geometry GII. We propose to analyze the work of three groups of students, inspired on a thesis experiment (Mithalal, 2010), with the purpose of highlighting the interactions between the material activity and the discursive genesis in the geometrical working spaces. © 2014, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

Data collection included an initial questionnaire, reports written by students in classrooms throughout the didactic unit ""functions"" and an interview with a couple of students after the apprentice. The results indicate that the coordination that students make between the various registers of representation of a function and of different functions allows them to achieve different perspectives of a function. The cognitive paradox of mathematical understanding was highlighted by the students through the coordination that they made of the records of semiotic representations (natural language, algebraic, tabular and graphic), which allowed them to stop confusing the mathematical object function with its representation, and also achieve a strong convergence of the concept image to the concept definition of function.","Concept definition of a function; Concept image of a function; Concept of function; Connections between representations; Semiotic representation of a function","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864749084"

These obstacles often remain unnoticed by the instructor, either because he/she has replaced in time his/her own (semantic) conceptions by others of a theoretical nature-overcoming thus the obstacle, but not being aware of it-or else because he/she has not yet made that substitution. In this paper, we present a particularly relevant illustration of the above, which refers to the persistence of an obstacle related to the concept of infinity in different stages of learning. Then we show an additional characteristic of the obstacle, that we call resistance. Subsequently, we use various theoretical approaches, properly didactic, to go into the question.

Analyses of teachers’ protocols were undertaken to identify formal, intuitive and algorithmic aspects (Fischbein, 1993).

The results were analyzed based on the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO). They showed that students are primarly in the prestructural and unistructural level, which means that they have isolated information about the different concepts involved in hypothesis testing and/or that they take into consideration some relevant aspect of the process without having full awareness of what they are doing. Moreover, it was noticed that there are misguided conceptions on the nature of hypothesis testing and the main concepts involved such as the level of significance, value p and the formulation of the hypothesis.","College students; Hypothesis testing; Misconceptions; Statistical inference; Statistical reasoning","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84889660384"

Based on the autobiographical writings of two teachers involved with Escola de Aperfeiçoamento, an institution of continuing education for teachers created by these reforms, we investigate proposals for the teaching and learning of mathematics conveyed in this training and the ways in which this training was mobilized in school practices in relation to mathematics. The article unfolds in four parts. The first one presents considerations about autobiographical writing. The second one deals with the autobiographical writings and their authors, Maria da Gloria Arreguy and Alda Lodi. The following section is intended to examine the references to the teaching of arithmetics in elementary school in the autobiographical writings of both. Finally, the text concludes with some considerations about the contributions of these documents for the history of mathematics education.","Arithmetics teaching; Autobiographical writings; History of mathematics education in Brazil; New Education","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84055197783"

In this exploratory study of the mathematical thinking of a selection of Year 7 and Year 8 students in Brazil, we found that when students were asked to solve numerical expressions using four arithmetic operations, most students opted for computational methods. However, when required to show relational thinking, most students did so, but clearly needed further support in this respect.","Algebraic thinking; Curriculum reform; Implications for teaching; Justification; Relational thinking","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870281166"

Six teachers participated in a weeklong professional development project that exposed them to mathematical ideas and contexts that related to, but were different from, classroom mathematics. At the end of the week, all teachers articulated wider and deeper connections between their classroom practices and mathematics outside the school. This work suggests that teachers need encouragement and support to explore the edges between classroom and professional uses of mathematics.

We try to understand that mathematical knowledge is not typical in works of art, but is a possible element for organizing the pictorial space and the thoughts of the artist.

More precisely, it focuses on what role empirical research may serve in the discussion of why to use history in mathematics education and how to do it. This is exemplified mainly by referring to two empirical research studies on the use of history in the Danish upper secondary mathematics program. Also it is illustrated how both the research design and research methodology of these two studies were dependant on the initial purpose of using history being concerned with history as a goal rather than history as a tool. Finally, perspectives are drawn on the possible benefits of increasing the amount of empirical research being done within the field of using history in mathematics education.","Empirical research; History as a goal; History as a tool; History in mathematics education; Research design and methodology; Students' beliefs and images of mathematics","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952098222"

In this paper, based on the onto-semiotic approach to mathematical cognition and instruction, we go more in-depth into the intended, assessed and personal meanings of a study process regarding the limit of a function. The results indicate that, despite some intuitive classes being analyzed in relation to the limit (i.e. without using the metric definition of ε and δ), students encounter numerous semiotic conflicts when interrelating with said concept.","Institutional meanings; Limit of a function; Personal meanings; Semiotic conflict; Teaching and learning","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84055191490"

This multimodal nature of cognition is compatible at different levels with the ontogenetic development of the brain-a development that turns out to be strongly related to the cultural context.

This argument is rooted in a framework in which the doing and learning of mathematics is regarded as a semiotic endeavour. Using Peirce's notion of a triadic sign (representamen, object and interpretant), I argue that the ability of the student to move between different representamen (representations) of the same mathematical object with CAS may help the student generate different interpretants (ideas in the mind) for this object. These multiple interpretants, based on multiple representamen, enable epistemological access to the object. I use Duval's distinction between conversions and treatments to distinguish between the different forms of semiotic activity with the CAS. To illustrate my arguments I examine a vignette in which two undergraduate university students use CAS while solving a mathematical problem.","Computer algebra system; Conversions and treatments; Maclaurin polynomial; Peirce sign; Semiotics","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955639711"

We observe that resorting to the history of the genesis of knowledge has permitted the identification of a variable in the mathematical content of the curriculum which influences the acquisition of the notions and procedures of calculus. At some point, the what to teach becomes part of how to teach and from there mathematics activity takes on a didactic sense in the classroom.

The methodological characteristics of the research were qualitative and interpretative. Rather than using previously established hypotheses as a starting point, collected data was used and categories and conjectures were generated, the validity of which was tested during the research. The research shows that this particular professional teacher training, as well as the use of dynamic geometric software, helped to modify the conceptions of teachers in relation to mathematical objects and helped them to adjust them to the reference meanings.","Dynamic geometric software; Institutional meaning; Personal meaning; Problem solving; Professional teacher training","","Spanish","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053120988"
